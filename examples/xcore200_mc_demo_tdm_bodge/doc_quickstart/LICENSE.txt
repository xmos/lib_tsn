            pursuant to a separate support agreement (the "XMOS Support

            support may be found via the XMOS website.

   8. Warranty and Disclaimer

         The XMOS Software is provided "AS IS" without a warranty of any
         kind. XMOS and its licensors' entire liability and Customer's
         exclusive remedy under this warranty to be determined in XMOS's
         sole and absolute discretion, will be either (a) the corrections
         of defects in media or replacement of the media, or (b) the
         refund of the licence fee paid (if any).

         Whilst XMOS gives the Customer the ability to load their own
         software and applications onto XMOS devices, the security of
         such software and applications when on the XMOS devices is
         the Customer's own responsibility and any breach of security
         shall not be deemed a defect or failure of the hardware. XMOS
         shall have no liability whatsoever in relation to any costs,
         damages or other losses Customer may incur as a result of any
         breaches of security in relation to your software or
         applications.

         XMOS AND ITS LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS
         OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
         MERCHANTABILITY/ SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
         THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID UNDER
         APPLICABLE LAW.

   9. High Risk Activities

         The XMOS Software is not designed or intended for use in
         conjunction with on-line control equipment in hazardous
         environments requiring fail-safe performance, including
         without limitation the operation of nuclear facilities,
         aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic
         control, life support machines, or weapons systems
         (collectively "High Risk Activities") in which the failure of
         the XMOS Software could lead directly to death, personal
         injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. XMOS and
         its licensors specifically disclaim any express or implied
         warranties relating to use of the XMOS Software in connection
         with High Risk Activities.

  10. Liability

         TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER XMOS
         NOR ITS LICENSORS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE,
         BUSINESS, PROFIT, CONTRACTS OR DATA, ADMINISTRATIVE OR
         OVERHEAD EXPENSES, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
         INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS
         OF THEORY OF LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENCE, EVEN IF
         XMOS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In
         no event shall XMOS's liability to the Customer whether in
         contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise exceed
         the Licence Fee.

         Customer agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend XMOS
         and its licensors from and against any claims or lawsuits,
         including attorneys' fees and any other liabilities, demands,
         proceedings, damages, losses, costs, expenses fines and
         charges which are made or brought against or incurred by XMOS
         as a result of your use or distribution of the Licensee
         Modifications or your use or distribution of XMOS Software
         other than in accordance with the terms of this Licence.

  11. Ownership

         The copyrights and all other intellectual and industrial
         property rights for the protection of information with respect
         to the XMOS Software (including the methods and techniques on
         which they are based) are retained by XMOS and/or its
         licensors. Nothing in this Agreement serves to transfer such
         rights. Consequently, subject to Clause 5, Customer may not
         sell, mortgage, underlet, sublease, sublicense, lend or
         transfer possession of the XMOS Software in any way whatsoever
         to any third party who is not bound by this Agreement.
